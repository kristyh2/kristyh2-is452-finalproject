# kristyh2-is452-finalproject
This holds materials for my final project in IS452. The purpose of my final project is to develop a program that grades assignments for completion credit.

## Project Abstract

The purpose of this programming project is to develop a program that will grade assignments and assign a completion grade to each student. This tool is not intended for assignments that require the evaluation of ideas or other forms of abstract thinking. Instead, this tool is better-suited for assignments that are graded on the student's ability to follow instructions delineated by the administrator. This tool may be particularly useful to instructors in large lecture classes who would like to expedite the process of assigning completion credit to students based on some objective criterias.

This program is able to complete the following tasks:

* Input a list of IDs (e.g., a class roster; UIN) and also a list of txt files (e.g., assignment submissions) to assign grades to those who completed the assignment.

Beyond this basic task, this program is able to assign a weighted grade to each student based on the following criteria:
* Follows basic instructions outlined in the rubric
* Meets word limit criteria
* Contains keywords relevant to the topic of the assignment
* Answers questions correctly

## Sample Assignment Instructions (Feel free to copy and paste this text into your assignment instructions)

To receive a grade for this assignment, you must follow the following formatting requirements:
1. The first line of your assignment must be [Insert name of Assignment].
2. The second line of your assignment must be your UIN.
For example:
  CMN529_ASSN1
  UIN: 67203477

3. Name your assignment "CMN_ASSN1_YOURUIN" (e.g., CMN529_ASSN1_67203477)
4. Submit you assignment as a word document (e.g., CMN529_ASSN1_67203477.doc) and a plain text file (e.g., CMN529_ASSN1_67203477.txt). You will be graded based on the contents of your text file submission. Please make sure to double-check that you meet these formatting requirements before submitting.
